Prog320 MidTerm
============

Game Using Crafty and Angular JS librarys served up via node with MongoLab db and json data

Items of Interest
-----------------
Charlie,

I am submiting this version as ground zero with the changes / additions you asked us to fulfill for the midterm.
You will notice my use of horrible ugly bitmaps - but I have indeed changed them per spec.
I added my sound file to replace yours.
I used a hack to add the MongoLab db and json data BUT as this is success NUMBER ONE I AM HAPPY.
I have the elementary testing set for further improvements.


Changes to come
-------

- Beautify my files and folders
- Have MongoLab and json print directly to game page 
-(is this possible? I know you can only have one ng-controller per page, right?
- Appropriate and Nice looking graphics.
